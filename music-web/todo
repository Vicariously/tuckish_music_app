Need to re-add datasources

Need to un-hardcode the context paths

Need to properly inject the MP3Tag libraries (currently in classpath via src/main/resources/3rdPartyLibs) 
   into Translator or find a good replacement for these libs in Maven....
   
Need to add sql scripts to create following tables: genre, artist, song, album

Need to add partial content response (error 206) to the streaming controller 
   so all playback functions are available in jPlayer via Chrome browser
  
In index.html (for now) need to capture the keypress event for ENTER key, if the playback has
   been paused directly after a ff or rw action has ended, in order to continue playback.
